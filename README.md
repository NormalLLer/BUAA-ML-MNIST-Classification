# BUAA "Fundamentals of Machine Learning Engineering" Assignments

[中文版](./README_zh.md)

[TOC]

This repository contains the assignments for the "Fundamentals of Machine Learning Engineering" course at Beihang University (BUAA). The assignments involve training models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of a large collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, allowing us to evaluate the performance of our models.

## Assignments
The repository is organized into two main folders, each corresponding to a specific assignment:

### MNIST Classification with SVM

In the "MNIST-Classification-with-SVM" folder, you will find an assignment that focuses on training a Support Vector Machine model for digit classification on the MNIST dataset. The SVM algorithm aims to find an optimal hyperplane that separates the different classes in the dataset.

### MNIST Classification with CNN

The "MNIST-Classification-with-CNN" folder contains an assignment that explores training a Convolutional Neural Network model for digit classification on the MNIST dataset. CNNs have shown remarkable success in image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies in the data.

## Repository Structure and Usage
